Task 1 -- GitHub Skills Test ***

!!!!!!!!Preparation

Installed the DEVASCVM

!!!!!!!!Implementation

First created a new repository on Github where i invited our instructor.
Then we did a "git init" on the newly created "Devasc_Skills" directory. Created a "README.md" file and added the remote repository through "git remote add origin https://github.com/vanlintbram/Devasc_Skills.git". Afterwards created a main branch "git branch -M main" and pushed the code: "git push -u origin main"

!!!!!!!!Troubleshooting

Tried to push the changes without having pointed the remote repository.

!!!!!!!!Verification

View changes on Github.
